This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Todo with React, Redux, ES6 and unit testing (Enzyme and Jest)

The aim of this application was to get more confortable with Redux and unit testing.

The following has been used:

- propTypes validation to make sure that we are passing the right data through the props
- unit testing to safeguard the codebase against any future changes
- ES6 to take advantage of the latest JS benefits (spread operator, destructuring, arrow function)
- functional programming aspects (the use of pure functions and exsisting methods like filter and map)
- containers to make the code more decoupled from the business logic
- SASS was used but mainly to gurantee a minimium styling to the application

## Further considerations

- the form would definetely benefit from a validation
- localStorage could be added to gurantee the application to work regardless of the network being down
- UI could be improved with a more appropriate design
- further snapshots test could be added
- a filtering functionlaity could be added
